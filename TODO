- flatten dir structure (include/gba -> include)
- name remaining ewram symbols
- decompile the rest of the game
  - priorities: code_manim > other code (event, statscreen, prepscreen and save might be good to do next) > code_banim > code_sio
- clean up hard asm (not decompilable) in asm/ and move them to src/
- dump data (lmao)
