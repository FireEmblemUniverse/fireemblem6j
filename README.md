# Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade

This is a decompilation of Fire Emblem: FÅ«in no Tsurugi (a.k.a. Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade).

It builds the following ROM:

* **[fe6.gba]** `sha1: a57095da867de4d585c33d4394712986245fe6ca`

GBAFE decompilation progress history can be found on [laqieer's FE decomp portal][fe-decomp-portal].

[fe6.gba]: https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=0367
[fe-decomp-portal]: https://laqieer.github.io/fe-decomp-portal/

## Quick setup

- get a `arm-none-eabi` binutils toolchain (devkitARM works).
- get a copy of the original rom (still required for every build for now), put it in this folder and name it `fe6-base.gba`.
- run [tools/install-agbcc.sh](tools/install-agbcc.sh) or get an agbcc another way.
- `make compare`

In the future, a native GCC or GCC-like C compiler (such as clang) will be required to build tools, there is just no tool to build yet.

## Contributing

Please do. I'm going to be pretty strict on what I accept though, so mind your formatting and naming conventions.

You can also consider porting stuff between fe6 and fe8.
