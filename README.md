# Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade

This is a decompilation of Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade.

It builds the following ROM:

* **[fe6.gba]** `sha1: a57095da867de4d585c33d4394712986245fe6ca`

[fe6.gba]: https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=0367

## Quick setup

- get devkitARM. Other `arm-none-eabi` toolchain work too.
- get a copy of the original rom (still required for every build for now), put it in this folder and name it `fe6-base.gba`.
- run [tools/install-agbcc.sh](tools/install-agbcc.sh) or get agbcc another way.
- `make compare`

## Contributing

Please do. I'm going to be pretty strict on what I accept though, so mind your formatting and naming conventions.

You can also consider porting stuff from fe6 over to fe8.
